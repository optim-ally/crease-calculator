What's in the name?
-------------------

The name **Origametry** is a `portmanteau <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_word>`_ of "origami" - the ancient Japanese art of paper folding - and "geometry" - the mathematical study of points, lines and surfaces (among other things).

It has been used to describe the field of computational origami for several years, and may have been first used by Thomas Hull in his `book <https://www.cambridge.org/us/universitypress/subjects/mathematics/recreational-mathematics/origametry-mathematical-methods-paper-folding>`_ of the same name.
